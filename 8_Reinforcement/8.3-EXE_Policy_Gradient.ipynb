    "# Solve cartpole with REINFORCE\n",
    "\n",
    "> By Jonas Busk ([jbusk@dtu.dk](mailto:jbusk@dtu.dk))\n",
    "\n",
    "**2019 update:** Changes have been made to the display of environments due to the previous `viewer` being incompatible with newer versions of Gym.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this part, we will create an agent that can learn to solve the [cartpole problem](https://gym.openai.com/envs/CartPole-v0/) from OpenAI Gym by applying a simple policy gradient method called REINFORCE.\n",
    "In the cartpole problem, we need to balance a pole on a cart that moves along a track by applying left and right forces to the cart.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will implement a probabilistic policy, that given a state of the environment, $s$, outputs a probability distribution over available actions, $a$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "p_\\theta(a|s)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The policy is a neural network with parameters $\\theta$ that can be trained with gradient descent.\n",
    "When the set of available actions is discrete, we can use a network with softmax output do describe the distribution.\n",
    "The core idea of training the policy network is quite simple: *we want to maximize the expected total reward by increasing the probability of good actions and decreasing the probability of bad actions*. \n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve this, we apply the gradient of the expected discounted total reward (return):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "\\nabla_\\theta \\mathbb{E}[R|\\theta] &= \\nabla_\\theta \\int p_\\theta(a|s) R({a}) \\, da \\\\\n",
    "&= \\int \\nabla_\\theta p_\\theta(a|s) R(a)  \\, da \\\\\n",
    "&= \\int p_\\theta(a|s) \\nabla_\\theta \\log p_\\theta(a|s) R(a) \\, da \\\\\n",
    "&= \\mathbb{E}[\\nabla_\\theta \\log p_\\theta(a|s) R(a)]\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "by definition of expectation and using the identity \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\nabla_\\theta p_\\theta(a|s) = p_\\theta(a|s) \\nabla_\\theta \\log p_\\theta(a|s) \\ .\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The expectation cannot be evaluated analytically, but we have an environment simulator that when supplied with our current policy $p_\\theta(a|s)$ can return a sequence of *actions*, *states* and *rewards*. This allows us to replace the integral with a Monte Carlo average:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\nabla_\\theta \\mathbb{E}[R|\\theta] \\approx \\frac{1}{T} \\sum_{t=0}^T \\nabla_\\theta \\log p_\\theta(a_t|s_t) R_t \\ ,\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "which is our final gradient estimator, also known as REINFORCE. In the Monte Carlo estimator we run the environment simulator for a predefined number of steps with actions chosen stochastically according to the current stochastic action network $p_\\theta(a|s)$."
